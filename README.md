# Test-trip

 Project is written with React.js + Typescript. For state management 
 I've used redux with `@reduxjs/toolkit` module and for
 routing its `react-router`. All component are custom-made 
 with `styled-components` library except date picker
 (I used `react-datepicker` and styled it a bit). Also, some
 icons were taken from `react-icons`.
